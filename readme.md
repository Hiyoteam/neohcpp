NeoHCPP (temporary name) is the next generation of hack.chat web client. **NOTE: This project is not related with C++.**

NeoHCPP（暂时的名字）是下一代hack.chat网页客户端。**注意：这一项目与C++无关。**

After several trials to create the next generation of hack.chat web client, this is the project to create it with complete rewrite and Vanilla JavaScript. Former failures include reforking the original legacy hack.chat web client, and migeration of current HC++(Hack.Chat Client Plus Plus) to ESM TypeScript.
